abstract: >-
  $360\degree$ videos require significant bandwidth to provide an immersive viewing experience. Wireless systems using
  terahertz (THz) frequency band can meet this high data rate
  demand. However, self-blockage is a challenge in such systems.
  To ensure reliable transmission, this paper explores THz-enabled
  360◦ video streaming through multiple multi-antenna access
  points (APs). Guaranteeing users’ quality of experience (QoE)
  requires accurate viewport prediction to determine which video
  tiles to send, followed by asynchronous bitrate selection for those
  tiles and beamforming design at the APs. To address users’
  privacy and data heterogeneity, we propose a content-based
  viewport prediction framework, wherein users’ head movement
  prediction models are trained using a personalized federated
  learning (PFL) algorithm. To address asynchronous decision-
  making for tile bitrates and dynamic THz link connections, we
  formulate the optimization of bitrate selection and beamforming
  as a macro-action decentralized partially observable Markov
  decision process (MacDec-POMDP) problem. To efficiently tackle
  this problem for multiple users, we develop two deep reinforce-
  ment learning (DRL) algorithms based on multi-agent actor-critic
  methods and propose a hierarchical learning framework to train
  the actor and critic networks. Experimental results show that
  our proposed approach provides a higher QoE when compared
  with three benchmark algorithms.
