> _“We’re rethinking wireless communication from the ground up — with **AI at the core**. Instead of relying on **fixed protocols** or **hand-crafted signal processing**, we’re using **AI models** to learn how to optimize the communication process itself. This means learning how to adapt **modulation**, **scheduling**, **routing**, and even **user behavior prediction in real time**.”_

> _“In some areas, we use **large language models (LLMs)** to handle **semantic communication**, making the system aware of **what is being transmitted and why**. But we go beyond that. We’re also looking at **reinforcement learning** for **dynamic resource allocation**, **neural receivers** that can decode more efficiently, and **collaborative AI agents** that manage networked devices like **fleets of drones** or **autonomous vehicles**.”_

> _“Ultimately, the goal is to make wireless systems more **intelligent**, more **resilient**, and more **efficient**, especially in **complex and fast-changing environments** like **6G networks**, **smart cities**, or **edge AI applications**.”_
